# No Modron Leveling
## Description:
An add on that will level and specialize champions without Modron Automation.
#
## Instructions:
Instructions:
1. If it is your first time using, press the 'Select/Create Spec. Settings' button and select the desired specializations for each champion.
2. If it is your first time using, press the 'Load Max. Lvl Data' button.
3. In game, load the desires formations to formation favorites 1/Q, 2/W, and/or 3/E.
4. Check the appropriate boxes on the script for the formation favoriates you want leveled and specialized.
5. Press the 'Level and Specialize' Button.
6. A message box should notify you when complete.

Notes:
1. When a new champion is added you will need to repeat Instruction steps 1 and 2.
2. When a soft cap increase is released you will need to repeat Instruction step 2.
3. If a champion rework or rebalance results in different or new upgrades you may need to repeat Instruction steps 1 and 2.

Known Issues:
1. Occasionally, the upgrade lists are not read correctly from memory. You will know this is the case when the Select Specialization window opens and champions you own are not present or the drop down lists to select specializations are blank. If this occurs, please make sure the game is running and reload the script.
2. The script can click before the specialization window appears or after it is gone, resulting in a champion formation dialogue opening. This should not interfere with the script functionality.
